> Note: All the numbers here are too small, my best guess is because I ran it on WSL since I'm on windows.

### Biggest 3 files in `var`

In the screenshot I'm using the du with the a and h option, to show the data for files and dirs and in a human readable way, then pipe it to sort, to sort it in decreasing order and finally pipe it to head to only get the top 3.

## Task 2

For task 2, I had terraform already installed from when I took the course in bachelor's but I couldn't build because the server refused to connect, I even tried a piad VPN service but it didn't connect.
